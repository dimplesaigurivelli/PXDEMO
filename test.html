        <p> Net Promoter Score® (NPS®) survey is a method to measure customer’s satisfaction with your product or
            service and predict business growth. The NPS® is calculated based on asking customers a question that
            predicts the probability of both retention and advocacy. Customers respond to the question by rating you on
            a scale of 0 to 10. This survey allows customers to provide open-ended comments or suggestions about your
            product or service.

            For example, you could ask your customers: “How likely is it that you would recommend this product/company
            to a friend or colleague?” Based on their response, you can classify them into one of these categories:
            Detractors, Passives, and Promoters. For more information on how to build NPS® survey, refer to the Create
            NPS Survey Engagements article from the Additional Resources section.
            Customer Effort Score (CES) survey helps you measure the ease with which customers use your product or
            services. This survey allows the customer to rate your product/service on a Likert Scale of 1 to 7. A score
            in the 1-3 range implies that the user faced difficulty in using your product or service while the score in
            the 4-7 range implies that the user found it simpler and easier while working with your product.
            With a Rating survey, you can create a survey where you ask customers to indicate how satisfied they are
            with your product or service. You can create single or multiple questions and provide the option to choose
            the answer from a rating scale. The rating scale helps you to measure the responses in a quantitative
            manner.
            Gainsight PX allows you to create a new engagement by copying an existing one. This eliminates the need to
            create your engagement from scratch. With the engagement cloning feature, engagement copies can be created
            across different environments and products in your subscription.
